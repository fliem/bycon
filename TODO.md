* [ ] disentangle general configurations, resources (which stay with the package)
  and instance-specific ones and load them from their appropriate locations
    - `beaconServer` and `services` scripts need to (over-) load from configs
      within their directories
    - this is in principle already possible, just need disentanglement etc.
