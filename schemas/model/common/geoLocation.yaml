  A GeoLocation object represents a geographic location formatted as a *GeoJSON feature*. The format is compatible with RFC 7946, while currently limiting its scope to features of type "Point". Also, the schema defines some optional parameters compatible with the GeoJSON feature *properties* wrapper object.
  Examples could be:  
  * an address, e.g. of a lab performing an analysis
  * provenance of an individual, obfuscated to a larger order 
  administrative entity (Suffolk, U.K.)
  * a lat/long/alt position where an environmental sample was collected
