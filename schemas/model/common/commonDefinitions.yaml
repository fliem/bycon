title: Common Definitions
description: >-
  Definitions for concepts used in several entry types, but that having only one
  property are not complex enough to require a full independent schema document.
definitions:
  Sex:
    description: >-
      (Genomic) sex of the individual.
      The standard specification recommends values from NCIT General Qualifier
      (NCIT:C27993):
      
      * NCIT:C17998 - unknown
      * NCIT:C16576 - female
      * NCIT:C20197 - male

      Another option is to use PATO `genotypic sex` classes.

      Progenetix uses PATO `genotypic sex` classes.
    $ref: ontologyTerm.yaml#/properties
    examples:
      - id: PATO:0020002
        label: female genotypic sex
      - id: PATO:0020001
        label: male genotypic sex

  Ethnicity:
    description: >-
      Ethnic background of the individual. Value from NCIT Race (NCIT:C17049)
      ontology term descendants can be used, e.g. NCIT:C126531 (Latin American).
      "A geographic ancestral origin category that is assigned to a population
      group based mainly on physical characteristics that are thought to be distinct
      and inherent."
      CAVE: Contentious and potentially misleading concept.
