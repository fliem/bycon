    "description": "A GeoLocation object represents a geographic location formatted as a *GeoJSON feature*. The format is compatible with RFC 7946, while currently limiting its scope to features of type \"Point\". Also, the schema defines some optional parameters compatible with the GeoJSON feature *properties* wrapper object. Examples could be:   * an address, e.g. of a lab performing an analysis * provenance of an individual, obfuscated to a larger order  administrative entity (Suffolk, U.K.) * a lat/long/alt position where an environmental sample was collected  \n",
