          \ schema. \n* 'ontologyTerm' is an term that belongs to a tree of concepts,\
          \ hence suitable to operations like 'query by similarity' or 'include all\
          \ descendants'. Many ontology terms are a value in itself (like 'female'),\
          \ hence no further information is required to solve the query.\n* 'alfanumeric'\
          \ is a field or an ontology term (like 'age') that requires a value to complete\
          \ the intended query. Only attributes of known schemas SHOULD be used here.\
          \ For attributes that are not part of the known schemas, the 'custom' type\
          \ MUST be used.\n* 'custom' is anything that doesn't fit the previous categories\
          \ and mainly for custom dictionaries that have no ontology nor a corresponding\
          \ attribute in the known schemas. Usually only makes sense for close partners\
          \ that are familiar with the custom dictionary.\n"
